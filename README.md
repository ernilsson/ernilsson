## E. R. Nilsson

Hello there, I am E. R. Nilsson. I'm not necessarily trying to keep my full name a secret but I will also not be publishing it immediately on this README. I figured I should tell you that before you think of me as some pretentious something-or-other.

### About
I'm a software developer based in Sweden with a major interest in most things technology (except for AI, or at least the current state of AI). I tend towards smaller pet projects over large long running commitments since most of what I publish here on GitHub are things I build for fun. This essentially means that the moment I get sick of working on something here I will swiftly wrap it up and move on to the next shiny thing. This, of course, does *not* reflect how I operate in a professional environment. 

### Technologies
I pride myself on being able to quickly pick up new technologies and will therefore always strive to use the best tool for the job. Sometimes that does not necessarily mean that I will use the best tool with respect to the actual project at hand since the purpose of my projects often are to learn new technologies and/or concepts. With that said, I generally tend to reach for the Go programming language, or sometimes C. Professionally, I work a lot with Java 8+ so there's a chance that a Java project pops up eventually.
